=RFC: New API to Unify WEXT (iwlibs) and nl80211 Interfaces in pythonwifi=

Started: 20110317
Rev. 20130220-01

This document attempts to outline a new API for pythonwifi going forward from v0.5.  Everything in this Request For Comment is open for discussion
and change.  The API described here is a starting point for such a discussion. That argument will take place on pythonwifi-dev@lists.berlios.de.  If you would like to comment on this API, please subscribe and become involved.

==History==

pythonwifi, in its current state, is a pure Python distribution, developed under Python 2, for controlling wireless network device configuration in
Linux systems using the WEXT ioctls.  The WEXT interface is the long-time access method for configuration and control of wireless devices in the Linux
kernel (i.e. iwconfig and iwlist).  However, WEXT has been deprecated since at least 2007 and nl80211 is the new interface that Linux kernel developers
are encouraging.

pymnl is a newly written pure Python distribution to aid communicating with the Netlink system (which underlies the nl80211 protocol).  pymnl does not
know about nl80211, but it can be used as a foundation by pythonwifi to add nl80211 access, along with the current WEXT access.


==Future==

I am proposing that pythonwifi add nl80211 and clean up the existing API so that a unified interface for WEXT and nl80211 will be possible.  This means
identifying those functions needed by pythonwifi users and providing those functions using the same class and method naming for the WEXT and nl80211 modules.  One goal of this reorganizaion is that the module used may be swapped out for the other module without requiring much, if any, other changes to the user's source code.

A second goal is to make pythonwifi compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 in the same source.


==Terminology==

This document tries to follow the Python community conventions, as I understand them, for terminology relating to software libraries.  The overall
group of files is a distribution, the distribution under consideration is named pythonwifi.  A package is a subgroup of files within a distribution.
The root package is the top of the hierarchy and is the base of the distribution.  The pythonwifi distribution will contain two packages
below the root package: nl80211 and wext.

A module is an individual file in the distribution.  This file may be within the root package or any subpackages in the hierarchy.

Where pseudo-code is used to illustrate the proposed API, an informal data type is used to hint at the values to be passed into and returned from the
method.  As Python is not a strongly-typed language, these types are only used to indicate general data types.

The term "wireless client developers" is used to describe those programmers controlling the wireless hardware via requests to the driver from userspace. So the developers in question are requesting service from the wireless driver.  This term is used to more clearly distinguish the pythonwifi target audience from device/driver developers.

For the definitions of technical terms as they are used in this document, see the glossary at the end of this document.


==New API==

===Distribution Layout===

The new package will be named pythonwifi.nl80211. The existing pythonwifi package will be moved down to pythonwifi.wext.  That is, the current file
hierarchy will be changed from

{{{
pythonwifi/__init__.py
}}}
to
{{{
pythonwifi/__init__.py
pythonwifi/nl80211/__init__.py
pythonwifi/wext/__init__.py
}}}

This means the package(s) would be imported with:

{{{
import pythonwifi.nl80211
import pythonwifi.wext
}}}

Although, only one package should be required at one time.


===Module Layout===

The main module in each package will be {{{__init__.py}}} so that importing the package will provide access to the primary class(es) to be used by wireless
client developers.  The module containing the most common constants used by each protocol will be named flags.py.  The module containing common
utilities required for the protocol, but not necessarily needed by wireless client developers, will be named base.py.  Each package may have additional
modules which provide additional protocol support.

{{{
pythonwifi/(nl80211|wext)/__init__.py
pythonwifi/(nl80211|wext)/flags.py
pythonwifi/(nl80211|wext)/base.py
}}}


====Root Package Functions and Classes====

pythonwifi/__init__.py will contain utility functions useful to wireless client developers that are not directly wireless oriented (e.g. retrieve
a list of NICs and wireless NICs or convert an interface name to its index). These are not required to be in classes, but a group of functions may be
put into a class if it makes sense.

{{{
def get_nic_names()
def get_wnic_names()
def get_phy_names()  XXX
def get_wiphy_names()  XXX
def if_nametoindex(string)
def mw2dbm(mwatt):
    """ Convert mW to dBm (float). """
    pass
}}}

===Package Classes===

The primary classes of interest to pythonwifi users will be named Wireless and ServiceSet.  These class names will be the same in the nl80211 and WEXT
packages.  Secondary classes for less common operations (i.e. WirelessConfig) will be in the same module.


====Wireless Class====

Note that the method names used below are a dramatic change from the current method names used in pythonwifi <= 0.5.  One of the goals with this method renaming is to make pythonwifi more compliant with PEP 8.

The methods included in the Wireless class should be only those most likely to be useful for wireless client developers.  Therefor, all methods in
Wireless should operate in both the nl80211 and wext packages.  See WirelessConfig for more commands.

{{{
class Wireless(object):
    """ Model of a wireless device.

        An exception may be raised if any of the following operations are

            place and False if no connection is in place.
        """
        return connection_state
}}}


====WirelessConfig Class====

The WirelessConfig class is a subclass of Wireless that aims to contain more of the information and commands available under each protocol.  Because each protocol provides a slightly different set of information and commands, the methods in WirelessConfig are not guaranteed to be the same in number, content, or function.

Many of the methods herein are for reading or assigning various options on the wireless network device.  These methods are not necessary for only
connecting to an access point, but are given for those wireless client developers that may want to accomplish other tasks with their clients.


=====WirelessConfig Common Methods=====

The methods listed here are those which will be in both packages' WirelessConfig.  Package-specific methods are given after this section and
are in addition to the API detailed here.

====ServiceSet Class====

Wireless.scan() in pythonwifi <= 0.5 returns an Iwscan object, which is too implementation specific.  In wext and nl80211 the result of a scan will be
a list of ServiceSet objects.

The attributes included in the ServiceSet class should be all those returned by the underlying protocol plus any meta-data likely to be helpful to
wireless client developers.  The amount of information in a ServiceSet depends on the amount of detail asked.  That is, a scan will return some information about a service set which will be placed in a ServiceSet object, but querying the SSID may place more information in the ServiceSet object.

ServiceSet will be a subclass of the Python dict built-in class.  The nl80211 and wext packages will each implement a custom constructor to make object
creation from the underlying system's data easier.  wext's ServiceSet will accept an Iwscanresult, while nl80211's ServiceSet will accept a pymnl
MessageList.  Each package will also implement a binary() method to return a representation of the object which can be used with wext or nl80211.

{{{
class ServiceSet(dict):
    @classmethod
    def from_data_str(cls, data_str):
        """ Create a new ServiceSet object from the binary data string
            returned from a scan.
        """
        self = cls()
        for (key, value_) in data_str:
            self[key] = value_
        return self

    def binary(self):
        """ Return a binary representation of the ServiceSet which can be
            used by the Python WiFi backend (i.e. wext or nl80211).
        """
        return data_str
}}}

Because ServiceSet is a subclass of dict, attribute access is dict access, e.g.

{{{
    >>> access_point = ServiceSet(Iwscanresult)
    >>> for (key, val) in access_point.items():
    ...     print(key, val)
    ...
    essid WinterPalace
    ap 00:11:22:33:44:55
    mode managed
    etc.
    >>> print('signal', access_point['signal'])
    signal 67
}}}


== Glossary ==

'Basic Service Set' (BSS) is two or more stations coordinating their communications, upon which a network can be formed.  This group of stations uses a BSSID to identify their common effort.

'Basic Service Set IDentifier' (BSSID) is a 48-bit number used to uniquely identify a BSS.  This value is usually the hardware address of the radio
in the device supervising the BSS and is often represented as a string of six colon-separated octets.

'Extended Service Set' (ESS) is a geographically distributed collection of multiple BSS that are linked together and presented to stations as a single BSS.

'Service Set' (SS) is a non-standard term used in pythonwifi generically referring to a BSS or ESS.  This is advertised to clients via the SSID.

'Service Set IDentifier' (SSID) is the (generally) human-readable string by which a service set can be identified.  It is included in a BSS and may be repeatedly used in the several BSS composing an ESS.  The SSID is from one (1) to thirty-two (32) octets in length.

'Station' is a radio-containing device which is designed to communicate wirelessly with other stations.  Specifically, this wireless communication is of the format detailed by the IEEE 802.11 standards.
